# COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY: DIGITAL PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION ACT, 2023 & RBI DIGITAL LENDING GUIDELINES

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP) is India's primary personal data protection legislation, enacted to recognize both the right to data protection and the need for lawful data processing. The Act applies to all digital personal data processing within India and to any organization offering goods/services to Indian Data Principals from outside India.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Digital Lending Directions, 2025 consolidate guidelines specifically for digital lending entities and their Lending Service Providers (LSPs). These directions address concerns around third-party engagement, data privacy, mis-selling, and unfair practices in digital lending.
